            Hello! I'm Olukolu Usman, a passionate frontend developer with a
            knack for creating clean and user-friendly web interfaces. With a
            strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy bringing
            designs to life and ensuring seamless user experiences. When I'm not
            coding, you can find me playing football, reading about the latest
            tech trends, or exploring new tools to enhance my development
            skills.
